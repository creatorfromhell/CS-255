### Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project was commissioned by DriverPass, a company looking to improve driver training to help clients pass DMV exams. The client, represented by Liam and Ian, required a system that could manage online training classes, practice tests, on-the-road training reservations, and tracking of driver-student schedules. The system would also provide role-based access for different users, track activity logs, manage customer appointments, and integrate with the DMV to stay up-to-date on requirements and practice content.

### Reflection on Key Strengths
One area of success in this project was the thorough identification and organization of client requirements. By creating detailed interview notes and clarifying functionality and user roles, I ensured that the project aligned well with DriverPass's goals. This process enabled me to develop an actionable project schedule and ensure the client had clarity on each deliverable.

### Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one aspect, it would be the timeline structure. I’d ensure more frequent milestone check-ins with DriverPass, allowing for incremental feedback and adjustments before moving to later development stages. This iterative approach would help address any minor misalignments early, improving overall project alignment and client satisfaction.

### Interpretation of User Needs and System Design
User needs were the foundation of this system design. For instance, identifying different user roles, such as the administrator, secretary, and student, enabled me to develop clear access controls and functionality specific to each role. Mapping these roles to requirements like scheduling, role-based access, and tracking ensured the system was intuitive and aligned with client expectations. Understanding user needs is essential in design, as it keeps the system focused on actual usage scenarios, enhancing user satisfaction and system relevance.

### Approach to Designing Software
My approach centers on an iterative process of requirement gathering, user role analysis, and feedback integration. For future projects, I’d emphasize techniques like user story mapping and frequent prototype reviews with stakeholders. These strategies provide context-rich insights into user expectations and help identify potential gaps early, ultimately leading to a more user-aligned and flexible system design.
